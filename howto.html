                    After you clicked the "Play BlackJack!" button, you will be
                    directed to the game.<br>
                    Then, you and the cashier will get two completely random
                    Cards from an API.<br>There you can see if you have won or lost
                    against the cashier
                </p>
            </div>

                <div class="grid-subtitle"><strong>How to  win</strong></div>
                <p class="grid-text">
                    To win our slightly changed version of BlackJack you simply have to win..<br>
                    If the sum of the both cards of yours is higher than the cashiers<br>or you
                    get a sum of exact "21" you won.

                <div class="grid-subtitle"><strong>How to lose</strong></div>
                <p class="grid-text">
                    If the sum of the players cards either is smaller than the cashiers<br>
                    or larger than "21" the player will lose.

                <p class="grid-text">
                    If both, the player and the cashier are should be getting 21, the game<br>
                    results in a tie and no one wins or loses.
