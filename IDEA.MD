### How to gain points
Both, the player and the computer will get two random cards.
If the sum of the players cards is larger than the computers,
the player will gain 1 point. 
If the sum of the players cards is exactly 21 the player will
gain 2 points.
If the computer and the players cards are exactly 21, the player
won't gain nor lose points.

### How to lose points
If the sum of the players cards is smaller than the computers,
or larger than "21" the player will loose his/her points.
